# models

Interfaces and their parsers are to be placed here.

## Interfaces

Those interfaces are to be used by the Apollo Resolver, etc.

## Parsers

They should parse the attributeMap provided by the DynamoDB output and
return the interface model that the Apollo Resolver expects.

`AttributeMap -> Interface`
